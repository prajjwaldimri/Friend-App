                        A black eye is caused by bleeding under the skin around the eye.
                        Most injuries that cause a black eye aren't serious. 
                        But a black eye may indicate a more serious injury,
                        such as an internal injury to the eye or a fracture of the thin bones 
                        around the eye. You may have a skull fracture if you have double vision,
                        bruising around both eyes (raccoon eyes) or bleeding from the nose.

                        A bruise forms when a blow breaks blood vessels near your skin's surface, allowing a small amount of blood to leak into the tissues under your skin. The trapped blood may cause a bruise that at first looks like a black-and-blue mark and then changes color as it heals.

If your skin isn't broken, you don't need a bandage. 
                        <LineBreak/>
                        But you can enhance bruise healing with these simple techniques:

                        <LineBreak/>
                        <LineBreak/>
-Elevate the injured area.
                        <LineBreak/>
-Apply an ice pack wrapped in a towel or a cloth dampened with cold water. Do this for about 10 minutes. Repeat several times a day for a day or two after the injury as needed.
                        <LineBreak/>
-Rest the bruised area, if possible.
                        <LineBreak/>
-Consider acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) for pain relief, or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for pain relief and to reduce swelling.

                        -Bandage the wound. First put a piece of gauze over the object. Then, if it helps, put clean padding around the object before binding the wound securely with a bandage or a piece of clean cloth. Take care not to press too hard on the object.

                        Shock may result from trauma, heatstroke, blood loss, an allergic reaction, severe infection, poisoning, severe burns or other causes. When a person is in shock, his or her organs aren't getting enough blood or oxygen. If untreated, this can lead to permanent organ damage or even death.
